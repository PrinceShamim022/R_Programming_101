# title : "Basic Prediction of Medical Cost using Linear Regression"


## 1. Intro
# This is an initial data analysis of regression with R.

##### Purpose

To make their own profits, the insurance company(insurer) must collect more premiums than the amount paid to the insured person.



For this, the insurance company invests a lot of time and money in creating a model that accurately predicts health care costs.





```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,warning=FALSE,message = FALSE)

options(warn=-1)

```





## 2. Reshape datasets

### 2-1) Import dataset & libraries

```{r message=FALSE}

insurance <- read.csv("insurance.csv")

options(warn=-1)

```

```{r}

str(insurance)

```





### 2-2) Remove 'region' columns

```{r}

insurance$region <- NULL

```



### 2-3) Convert Factor to Numeric

```{r}

ins <- insurance

#ins$sex <- as.numeric(ins$sex)
#ins$smoker <- as.numeric(ins$smoker)

ins$sex <- ifelse(ins$sex == "female", 1, 2)
ins$smoker <- ifelse(ins$smoker == "yes", 1, 2)

str(ins)

```



### 2-4) Add columns to distinguish between low charges and high charges (standard : mean(charges))

```{r}

ins$group <- ifelse(ins$charges > mean(ins$charges), "high", "low")

```



### 2-5) Check the Correlation Coefficient (except: group)

```{r}

cor(ins[-7])

```





## 3. Visualize (To see the total corr, you have to remove group columns : ins[-7])

### 3-1) Using chart.Correlation

```{r message=FALSE}

library(PerformanceAnalytics)

```

```{r chart}

chart.Correlation(ins[-7], histogram=TRUE, pch=1, 
                  main = "Insurance Scatterplot Matrix")

```



### 3-2) Using pairs.pannels

```{r message=FALSE}

library(psych)

```

```{r panels}

pairs.panels(ins[-7], pch=1, lm=TRUE, cex.cor=1, smoother=F, stars = T, main="Insurance Scatterplot Matrix")

```



### 3-3) Using ggpairs

```{r message=FALSE}

library(GGally)

```

```{r ggpairs}

ggpairs(ins[-7])

```



### 3-4) Visualize including group (View in different colors according to group)

```{r message=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

```

```{r group_ggpairs}

ggpairs(ins, aes(color=group, alpha=0.75), lower=list(continuous="smooth"))+ theme_bw()

```





## 4. Full Analysis

### 4-1) The value(columns) that most influences charges

```{r}

cor(ins[-7])[,"charges"]		# correlation coefficient

```

==> smoker(0.7872) >>> age(0.299) >> bmi(0.1983)









```{r}

ggcorr(ins[-7], name = "corr", label = TRUE)+

  theme(legend.position="none")

```



```{r message=FALSE}

library("factoextra")

```

```{r}

my_data <- ins[, c(1,3,4,5)];

res.pca <- prcomp(my_data, scale = TRUE)

fviz_pca_biplot(res.pca, col.ind = ins$group, 
                col = "black", palette = "jco", 
                geom = "point", repel=TRUE,
                legend.title="Charges")



fviz_pca_biplot(res.pca,geom.ind = "point", 
                col.ind = ins$group, pointsize = 2,
                palette = "jco", addEllipses = TRUE,
                label="var", col.var="black",
                repel=TRUE, legend.title="Charges")

```





### 4-2) Regression Analysis

```{r}

lm(charges~., data = insurance)	

```

- Smokers increases helath care costs(charges) by $23,823 per year.



- As the number of children increases, helath care costs(charges) can be increased by $474.



   --> guess: The increase in dependents can increase the cost of care such as hospital care, 

              immunization, and physical examinations every year.)

               

               

- The higher the age, the higher the medical costs.









## 5. Detailed Analysis

### 5-1) How do you make a model if you want to give a higher penalty to an obese&smoke person?

If 'bmi' exceeds 30, Let's categorized as obesity

```{r}

insurance$obese <- as.factor(ifelse(ins$bmi >=30, "yes", "no"))

```



### 5-2) Combine multiple variance and predict the best combination (to help raise the premiums)

```{r}

lm(charges ~ obese * smoker, data=insurance)

```



- obesity increases health care costs by $865, and smoking increases health care costs by $13,386.

- But the both components are applied, (if smoking and obesity are together), 

    It can be expected that medical expenses will increase the most with $19,329.













## 6. Analysis Conclusion

- By predicting health care charges using linear regression methods, it is possible to impose different insurance premiums depending on the charges.

- As a result of the model comparison above(4), by using * rather than +, the prediction of the model became more similar to reality.













## 7. Prediction Function

```{r}

pre_charges <- function(m, a, b, c){

    pre_new <- predict(m, data.frame(age=a, bmi=b, children=c))

    msg <- paste("age: ",a,", bmi: ",b,", children: ",c,"   ==> Expect Charges: $",round(pre_new),sep="")

    print(msg)

}

```





- example) age = 19, bmi = 27.9, children = 0

```{r}

model <- lm(charges ~ age+bmi+children, data=insurance)

pre_charges(model, 19, 27.9, 0)



```
